The Rules of Mastermind

1.) A key consists of four, six, or eight different colours in a specific order

depending on the gameype you choose


2.) You have ten guesses to guess a Key


3.) The game gives an output P: x and C: y


4.) P: tells you the number of the pieces that are the same colour and place as

a piece in the solution


5.) C: tells you the number of pieces that are the same colour but not the same

place as a piece in the solution
